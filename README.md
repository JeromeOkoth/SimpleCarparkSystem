The program simulates a car park system. It enables car park customers
to enter and exit the car park while keeping track of the number of available parking spaces and issues a
parking space identifier of each vehicle. It also allows users to query the parking record of their
vehicle by ticket number. All the parking records are then saved to comma-separated values (CSV)
file.
